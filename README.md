# Fabricatable machines timeline
*The brief history and highlights of the Fabricatable Machines project*

### Motivations for fabricatable machines:

- High degree of diy in a self made machine can give a stronger sense of self reliance
- Using cheap repairable machines makes for more play and different exploration/learning
- Sport
- Spending more hours and less money in sourcing a machine can help more businesses get started
- Lowering the threshold for customization helps more people create new types of machines
- Inspire people to understand more of the tools they use and rely on in their profession or hobby. Encourage hacking of existing machines.

### Motivations for making open hardware:

- Greater good / contribute to the pool you drink from 
- Social - better to build and share with with peers than on to work on your own
- Marketing of your skills and work

### Statistics

- 6 contributors of machine designs and subsystems
- 7 contributors of documentation
- 23+ unique machines developed and built at least once
- 8+ known individuals and 4+ groups who have reproduced fabricatable machine designs
- 37+ machines built in total from 2015-2025
- 5 international confrences where our reserch work has been presented *(FAB12, FAB13, FAB14, TEI2020, Software and Systems Modeling 2022)*
- Machines are in use, or have been used, in Fab Labs, business, artists workshops, hobby workshops, schools and academic institutions

# 2025

**Highlights**:
- Hanzo is rented out the artist Javier Barrios and converted to a classic CNC router conversion

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Machine conversion can be almost as much work as designing a machine from scratch


# 2024

**Highlights**:
- Frikk Fossdal succesfully defends his [PhD thesis](https://www.nb.no/items/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2024111248035) "Fabricatable Systems: Tools for computational design and digital fabrication"
- Jake Reads [hotplate toolchanging](https://clank.tools/tools/) design from Clank is added to Hanzo and knife [4th axis](https://github.com/Fabricatable-Machines/Hotplate-fabricatable-4th-axis) developed
- Additive wood experiement

*Clank toolchange system by Jake Read added to Hanzo)*


**Lessons learned**
- Having large work areas in X, Y, and Z is challenging but opens lots of opportunities for experiments


# 2023

**Highlights**:
- Hanzo becomes a commercial workhorse in Jens Dyvik's design studio and does its job as a research platform
- Two Huphrey 1.5s are upgraded with linear rails at Kuben vocational high school

![](https://github.com/Fabricatable-Machines/Hanzo/blob/main/img/hanzo-miiling-machine-parts-for-humphrey2.JPG)

**Lessons learned**
- Traveling tower gantry design works surprisingly well
- Non back drivable z axis drive *(like lead screws)* would have been a better design choice on Hanzo
- Rack teeth orientation is important in formica compact (fibers are in the X, Y plane)



# 2022

**Highlights**:
- Second research paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-022-01007-y) at Software and Systems Modeling 2022
- Jens Dyvik creates [Hanzo](https://github.com/Fabricatable-Machines/Hanzo/blob/main/README.md) research platform
- Jens Dyvik delivers two Humphrey2's to the Haiti Fab Lab project
- First successful self replication of a machine. One Humphrey2 makes about 80% of the parts for another Humphrey2
- Third generation achines stills holds good performance: Hanzo made a Humphrey2, this Humphrey2 made another Humphrey2

**


**Lessons learned**
- Reducing level of DIY by buying linear rails and gearboxes makes performance skyrocket
- The CNC friendly rack and pinion design handles self replication quite well
- Designing for plate based construction with HPL is a lot of work compared to design for aluminum extrusions or rectangular steel tubes


# 2021

**Highlights**:
- H-Axis developed by Jens Dyvik
- Construction from HPL plates explored
- The Fabricatable machines project is moved away from the origination page of Fellesverkstedet and is given its own github organization *(the R&D department at Fellesverkstedet did not gain sufficient momentum and Jens Dyvik stepped out of Fellesverkstedet to do independent design and research work)* 

![](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/people/jensdyvik/img/h-axes-lined-up.JPG)

**Lessons learned**
- HPL *(for instance Trespa or Formica Compact)* makes an interesting material for smaller machines and M3 screws


# 2020

**Highlights**:

- Frikk Fossdal develops []()

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/master/wiki-media/img/tei2020-paper-screenshot.PNG)

**Lessons learned**
- Machines designed for being CNC milled from POM makes it easy to include flexures in design and has ok performance



# 2019

**Highlights**:
- First known fabricatable machines replicated in the wild. *(Files downloaded from the internet by a thrid party and fabricated without support from the Fabricatable machines team)*
- First almost all wood machine with decent performance developed by Jens Dyvik, [Wood Humphrey]()
- Nikolai Kolstad, Torbjørn Nordvik Helgesen and high schools students from Kuben makes the fourth Humphrey 1.5

**Lessons learned**
- Parametric axis generators have a lot of potential
- Adding parallel slots to glide blocks *(reducing contact surface area)* helps improve performance in chamfer rail axis

**Lessons learned**
- Making machines from aluminum increases performance, but most potential machine fabbers find milling aluminum scary *(lowering the chance of reproduction of a design)*
- Open designs based on CNC milling has a much lower chance of reproduction that designs based on FDM 3D printing or laser cutting
- DIY Glide blocks from low friction plastic on self milled axes works terrible on large heavy machines
- Aluminum oxide build up on glide blocks and POM pinion teeth makes accelerates wear of plastic parts *(machined aluminum makes for good structural parts, but not suitable rail and self milled racks)*
- High quality closed loop motors can help compensate for low quality machine design


# 2016

**Highlights**:
- First complete machine made: V-bird
- First test of a fully parametric machine where the output is not geometry but .gcode files so that the machine parts can be directly manufactured *(no need to export cad files, import into CAM, make CAM, export gcode)*
- Parametric axis generator demoed at Fab12 Conference in Shenzen, China
- Award plotter trophy for oslo Innovation Award delivered by Jens Dyvik, Jon Nordby and Fellesverkstedet employees
- First version of CNC friendly rack and pinon developed by Jens Dyvik
- The Fabricatable Machines project is moved to The Fellesverkstedet github organization to help build up momentum for a R&D department at Fab Lab Fellesverkstedet

**Lessons learned**
- Fully parametric machine models is a lot of work and cumbersome to edit, really cool
- Parametric axes generators have a lot of potential
- DIY glide blocks from low friction plastic can be an alternative to bearings and increase diy level *(following this direction would later fool us into making underperforming and high maintenance machines like Humphrey, Hank and Hattori)*
- The CNC friendly rack and pinion geometry makes for faster production of DIY drive systems than involute gears, has good performance and makes it easy to integrate rack geometry in other machines parts

# 2015

**Highlights**:
- The Fabricatable Machines project was launched by Jens Dyvik and Jon Nordby
- First self made linear actuators

**Lessons learned**
- Keep part the count low. *(Better to put complexity in shapes. Let the machines make complex machines parts, and the humans do less assembling)*

**Fun fact:**
- Jens originally named the project "Tractor systems", because his goal was to make DIY robust enough that would not break down when used by amateurs in shared workshops. Jon and Jens came up with Fabricatable Machines and renamed the project and repository.
