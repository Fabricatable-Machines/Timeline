# Fabricatable machines timeline
*The brief history and highlights of the Fabricatable Machines project*

### Motivations for fabricatable machines:

- High degree of diy in a self made machine can give a stronger sense of self reliance
- Using cheap repairable machines makes for more play and different exploration/learning
- Sport
- Spending more hours and less money in sourcing a machine can help more businesses get started
- Lowering the threshold for customization helps more people create new types of machines
- Inspire people to understand more of the tools they use and rely on in their profession or hobby. Encourage hacking of existing machines.

### Motivations for making open hardware:

- Greater good / contribute to the pool you drink from 
- Social - better to build and share with with peers than on to work on your own
- Marketing of your skills and work

### Statistics

- 6 contributors of machine designs and subsystems
- 7 contributors of documentation
- 23+ unique machines develobed and built at least once
- 8+ known indivduals and 4+ groups who have reproduced fabricatable machine designs
- 37+ machines built in total from 2015-2025
- 5 international confrences where our reserch work has been presented *(FAB12, FAB13, FAB14, TEI2020, Software and Systems Modeling 2022)*
- Machines are in use, or have been used, in Fab Labs, business, artists workshops, hobby workshops, schools and academic institutions

# 2025

**Highlights**:
- Hanzo is rented out the artis Javier Barrios and converted to a classic CNC router conversion

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Machine conversion can be almost as much work as designing a machine from scracth


# 2024

**Highlights**:
- Frikk Fossdal succesfully defends his [PhD thesis](https://www.nb.no/items/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2024111248035) "Fabricatable Systems: Tools for computational design and digital fabrication"
- Jake Reads [hotplate toolchanging](https://clank.tools/tools/) design from Clank is added to Hanzo and knife [4th axis](https://github.com/Fabricatable-Machines/Hotplate-fabricatable-4th-axis) developed
- Additive wood experiement

*Clank toolchange system by Jake Read added to Hanzo)*


**Lessons learned**
- Having large work areas in X, Y, and Z is challinging but opens lots of oppurtinties for expriments


# 2023

**Highlights**:
- Hanzo becomse a commercial workhorse in Jens Dyviks design studio and does its job as a research platform
- Two Huphrey 1.5s are upgraded with linear rails at Kuben vocational high school

![](https://github.com/Fabricatable-Machines/Hanzo/blob/main/img/hanzo-miiling-machine-parts-for-humphrey2.JPG)

**Lessons learned**
- Traveing tower gantry design works surisingly well
- Not back drivable z axis drive *(like lead screws)* would have been a better desing choice on Hanzo
- Rack reeth oriention is important in formica compact (fibers are in the X, Y plane)



# 2022

**Highlights**:
- Second research paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-022-01007-y) at Software and Systems Modeling 2022
- Jens Dyvik creates [Hanzo](https://github.com/Fabricatable-Machines/Hanzo/blob/main/README.md) research platform
- Jens Dyvik delivers two Humphrey2's to the Haiti Fab Lab project
- First succesfull self replication of a machine. One Humphrey2 makes about 80% of the parts for another Humphrey2
- Third generation achines stills holds good performance: Hanzo made a Humphrey2, this Humphrey2 made another Humphrey2

**


**Lessons learned**
- Reducing level of DIY by buying linear rails and gearboxes makes performance skyrocket
- The CNC frinedly rack and pinion design handles self replicatino quite well
- Designing for plate based construction with HPL is a lot of work compared to desing for aluminum extrusions or rectangluar steel tubes


# 2021

**Highlights**:
- H-Axis developed by Jens Dyvik
- Constructio from HPL plates explored
- The Fabaricble machines project is moved away from the origniaztion page of Felelsverkstedet and i given its own github organization *(the R&D departement at Fellesvrekstedet did not gain sufficeient momenteum and Jens Dyvik stepped out of Fellesvrekstedet to work and research independent)* 

![](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/people/jensdyvik/img/h-axes-lined-up.JPG)

**Lessons learned**
- HPL *(for instance Trespa or Formica Compact)* makes an intertsing material for smallermachines and M3 screws

**Lessons learned**
- Patermic axes generators have a lot of potential

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/img/01humphrey-first-cuts.jpg)

**Lessons learned**
- Making machines from aluminum increases performance, but most potential machine fabbers find milling aluminum scary *(lowering the chance of repsroduction of a design)*
- Open designs based on CNC milling has a much lower chance of reproduction that designs based on FDM 3D printing or laser cutting
- DIY Glide blocks from low friction plastic on self milled axes works terrible on large heavy machines
- Aluminium oxide build up on glide blocks and POM pinion teeth makes accelaters waer of plastic parts *(machined aluminum makes for good structural parts, but not suitable rail and self milled racks)*
- High quality closed loop motors can help compoesate for low quality machine desgin


# 2016

**Highlights**:
- First complete machine made: V-bird
- First test of a fully paremtric machine where the output is not geometry but .gcode files so that the machine parts can be directly manufacured *(no need to export cad files, import into CAM, make CAM, export gcode)*
- Parametric axis generaor demoed at Fab12 Conference in Shenzen, China
- Award plotter trophy for oslo Innovation Award delivered by Jens Dyvik, Jon Nordby and Fellesverkstedet employees
- First version of CNC frindly rack and pinon developed by Jens Dyvik

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines-archive/master/award-plotter/img/00Award-winners-with-the-crown-prince-and-princess.JPG)

**Lessons learned**
- Fuly paremetric machine models is a lot of work and cumberome to edit
- Paremtric axes generators have a lot of potential
- DIY glide blocks from low friction plastic can be an alternative to bearings and increase diy level *(following this direction would later fool us into makingunderperfoming and high mainteance machines like Humphrey, Hank and Hattori)*
- The CNC frindly rack and pinion gemotry makes for faster production of DIY drive systems than involute gears, has good performance and makes it easy to intergrate rack geomery in other machiens parts

# 2015

**Highlights**:
- The Fabricatble Machines project was launched by Jens Dyvik and Jon Nordby
- First self made linear actuators

![](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines-archive/blob/master/Module%20development/Engraved%20rack%20and%20pinion/IMG_7400.JPG)


**Lessons learned**
- Keep part the count low. *(Better to put complexity in shapes. Let the machines make complex machines parts, and the humens do less assembling)*

**Fun fact:**
- Jens originaly named the project "Tractor systems", because his goal was to make DIY robust enough that would not break down when used by amateurs in shared workshops. Jon and Jens came up with Fabricatble Machines and renamed the project and repository.
