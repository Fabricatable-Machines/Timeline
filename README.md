# 2018

**Highlights**:
- Frikk Fossdal makes Hulti research platform, based on the chamfer rail axis generator
- Jakob Nilsson upgrades Humphrey 1.5 to roller bearing design instead of glide blocks, significanly improving performance
- Jakob Nilsson deliver three more Humphrye 1.5s to commecial customers, inlcuding Dala Makers makersapce

# 2017

**Highlights**:
- Jakob Nilsson, Torbj√∏rn Nordvik Helgesen, and Frikk Fossdal joined the Fabricatable Machines project
- Fab Academy student Jakbob Nilsson makes Hector, open frame CNC milling machine
- Chamfer rail paremtric axis ued by gloabl Fab Academy students in machine design week, and How to Make Almost anything students at MIT
- []() Second comercial machine delivered to a customer. Design concecpt by Jens Dyvik, design and manuafacturing by Jakbob Nilsson
- Hattori small format CNC demoed at Fab13 in Santiago, Chile
- First Humphrey Machine large fromat CNC milling machie desgined by Jens Dyvik and Aleax Schaub for Contact Makerspace Amsterdam
- Humphrey redsigned by Jakob Nilsson from the bottom up and delivered to third commercial customer.
- Hattori 3D printer edtion made for Oslo Innovation award by Jens Dyvik, Jakb nilsson and Erling Knutsen.

**Lessons learned**
- Making machines from aluminum increases performance, but most potential machine fabbers find milling aluminum scary *(lowering the chance of repsroduction of a design)*
- Open designs based on CNC milling has a much lower chance of reproduction that designs based on FDM 3D printing or laser cutting
- DIY Glide blocks from low friction plastic on self milled axes works terrible on large heavy machines
- Aluminium oxide build up on glide blocks and POM pinion teeth makes accelaters waer of plastic parts *(machined aluminum makes for good structural parts, but not suitable rail and self milled racks)*
- High quality closed loop motors can help compoesate for low quality machine desgin


# 2016

**Highlights**:
- First complete machine made: V-bird
- First test of a fully paremtric machine where the output is not geometry but .gcode files so that the machine parts can be directly manufacured *(no need to export cad files, import into CAM, make CAM, export gcode)*
- Parametric axis generaor demoed at Fab12 Conference in Shenzen, China
- Award plotter trophy for oslo Innovation Award delivered by Jens Dyvik, Jon Nordby and Fellesverkstedet employees
- First version of CNC frindly rack and pinon developed by Jens Dyvik

**Lessons learned**
- Fuly paremetric machine models is a lot of work and cumberome to edit
- Paremtric axes generators have a lot of potential
- DIY glide blocks from low friction plastic can be an alternative to bearings and increase diy level *(following this direction would later fool us into makingunderperfoming and high mainteance machines like Humphrey, Hank and Hattori)*

# 2015

**Highlights**:
- The Fabricatble Machines project was launched by Jens Dyvik and Jon Nordby
- First self made linear actuators

**Lessons learned**
- Keep part the count low. *(Better to put complexity in shapes. Let the machines make complex machines parts, and the humens do less assembling)*

**Fun facts:**
- Jens originaly named the project "Tractor systems", because his goal was to make DIY robust enough that would not break down when used by amateurs in shared workshops. Jon and Jens came up with Fabricatble Machines and renamed the project and repository.
