# 2016

**Highlights**:
- First complete machine made: V-bird
- First test of a fully paremtric machine where the output is not geometry but .gcode files so that the machine parts can be directly manufacured *(no need to export cad files, import into CAM, make CAM, export gcode)*
- Parametric axis generaor demoed at Fab12 Conference in Shenzen

**Lessons learned**
- Fuly paremetric machine models is a lot of work and cumberome to edit
- Paremtric axes generators have a lot of potential
- DIY glide blocks from low friction plastic can be an alternative to bearings and increase diy level *(following this direction would later fool us into makingunderperfoming and high mainteance machines like Humphrey, Hank and Hattori)*

# 2015

**Highlights**:
- The Fabricatble Machines project was launched by Jens Dyvik and Jon Nordby
- First self made linear actuators

**Lessons learned**
- Keep part the count low. *(Better to put complexity in shapes. Let the machines make complex machines parts, and the humens do less assembling)*

**Fun facts:**
- Jens originaly named the project "Tractor systems", because his goal was to make DIY robust enough that would not break down when used by amateurs in shared workshops. Jon and Jens came up with Fabricatble Machines and renamed the project and repository.
