# 2025

**Highlights**:
- Hanzo is rented out the artis Javier Barrios and converted to a classic CNC router conversion

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Machine conversion is almsot as much work as designing a machines from scracth


# 2024

**Highlights**:
- Frikk Fossdal succesfully defends his [PhD thesis](https://www.nb.no/items/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2024111248035) "Fabricatable Systems: Tools for computational design and digital fabrication"
- Jake Reads [hotplate toolchanging](https://clank.tools/tools/) design from Clank is added to Hanzo and knife [4th axis](https://github.com/Fabricatable-Machines/Hotplate-fabricatable-4th-axis) developed
- Additive wood experiement

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Having large work areas in X, Y, and Z is challinging but opens lots of oppurtinties for expriemts


# 2023

**Highlights**:
- Hanzo becomse a commercial workhorse in Jens Dyviks design studio and does its job as a research platform
- Two Huphrey 1.5s are upgraded with linear rails at Kuben vocational high school

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Traveing tower gantry design works surisingly well
- Not back drivable z axis drive *(like lead screws)* would have been a better desing choice on Hanzo
- Rack reeth oriention is important in formica compact (fibers are in the X, Y plane)



# 2022

**Highlights**:
- Second research paper [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-022-01007-y) at Software and Systems Modeling 2022

- Jens Dyvik delivers two Humphrey2's to the Haiti Fab Lab project
- First succesfull self replication of a machine. One Humphrey2 makes about 80% of the parts for another Humphrey2
- Third generation achines stills holds good performance: Hanzo made a Humphrey2, this Humphrey2 made another Humphrey2

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Reducing level of DIY by buying linear rails and gearboxes makes performance skyrocket
- The CNC frinedly rack and pinion design handles self replicatino quite well
- Designing for plate based construction with HPL is a lot of work compared to desing for aluminum extrusions or rectangluar steel tubes


# 2021

**Highlights**:
- H-Axis developed by Jens Dyvik
- Constructio from HPL plates explored

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- HPL *(for instance Trespa or Formica Compact)* makes an intertsing material for smallermachines and M3 screws


# 2020

**Highlights**:
- First research paper [published](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3374920.3374929) at TEI2020
- Frikk Fossdal develops []()

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Machines designed for being CNC milled from POM makes it easy to inlcue flexures in design and has ok performance



# 2019

**Highlights**:
- First known fabricable machines replicated in the wild. *(Files downloaded from the internet by thrid pary and partrs fabriacted without support from the Fabriacable machines team)*
- First almost all wood machine with decent performance developed by Jens Dyvik, [Wood Humphrey]()
- Nikolai Kolstad, Torbjørn Nordvik Helgesen and high schools students from Kuben makes the fourth Humphrey 1.5 

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Polycarbonte rack works quite well
- Valchomat HDF rails makes ok axes for amateur projects


# 2018

**Highlights**:
- Frikk Fossdal makes Hulti research platform, based on the chamfer rail axis generator
- Jakob Nilsson upgrades Humphrey 1.5 to roller bearing design instead of glide blocks, significantly improving performance
- Jakob Nilsson deliver three more Humphrye 1.5s to commecial customers, including Dala Makers makersapce
- Torbjørn Nordvik Helgesen redsigns Hattori from the ground up
- [Hobo](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines-archive/tree/master/hobo-large-format-cnc) is demoed at the Fab14 Conference in Toulouse, France, and test rigged to the roof of a car. Design concecpt by Jens Dyvik, design and manuafacturing by Torbjørn Nordvik Helgesen
- [Hector](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/tree/master/hector-medium-format-cnc) by Jakbob Nilsson is demoed at the Fab14 Conference in Toulouse, France
- [Hedy]() is developed as a trophy for Oslo Innovation Award. Design concecpt by Jens Dyvik, design and manuafacturing by Jakbob Nilsson.

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Patermic axes generators have a lot of potential
- Adding parralel slotts to glide blocks *(reducing contact surface area)* helps improve perfomcance in chamfer rail axis
- Inline roller skate wheels rolling in v groves makes a squishy and terrible machine axis


# 2017

**Highlights**:
- Jakob Nilsson, Torbjørn Nordvik Helgesen, and Frikk Fossdal joined the Fabricatable Machines project
- Fab Academy student Jakbob Nilsson makes Hector, open frame CNC milling machine
- Chamfer rail paremtric axis ued by gloabl Fab Academy students in machine design week, and How to Make Almost anything students at MIT
- [Humphtiro - medium format CNC]() second comercial machine delivered to a customer. Design concecpt by Jens Dyvik, design and manuafacturing by Jakbob Nilsson
- Hattori small format CNC demoed at Fab13 in Santiago, Chile
- First Humphrey Machine large fromat CNC milling machie desgined by Jens Dyvik and Aleax Schaub for Contact Makerspace Amsterdam
- Humphrey redsigned by Jakob Nilsson from the bottom up and delivered to third commercial customer.
- Hattori 3D printer edtion made for Oslo Innovation award by Jens Dyvik, Jakb nilsson and Erling Knutsen.
- Namig convention started, all Fabricatable Machine names start with the letter "H"


![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Making machines from aluminum increases performance, but most potential machine fabbers find milling aluminum scary *(lowering the chance of repsroduction of a design)*
- Open designs based on CNC milling has a much lower chance of reproduction that designs based on FDM 3D printing or laser cutting
- DIY Glide blocks from low friction plastic on self milled axes works terrible on large heavy machines
- Aluminium oxide build up on glide blocks and POM pinion teeth makes accelaters waer of plastic parts *(machined aluminum makes for good structural parts, but not suitable rail and self milled racks)*
- High quality closed loop motors can help compoesate for low quality machine desgin


# 2016

**Highlights**:
- First complete machine made: V-bird
- First test of a fully paremtric machine where the output is not geometry but .gcode files so that the machine parts can be directly manufacured *(no need to export cad files, import into CAM, make CAM, export gcode)*
- Parametric axis generaor demoed at Fab12 Conference in Shenzen, China
- Award plotter trophy for oslo Innovation Award delivered by Jens Dyvik, Jon Nordby and Fellesverkstedet employees
- First version of CNC frindly rack and pinon developed by Jens Dyvik

![]()

**Lessons learned**
- Fuly paremetric machine models is a lot of work and cumberome to edit
- Paremtric axes generators have a lot of potential
- DIY glide blocks from low friction plastic can be an alternative to bearings and increase diy level *(following this direction would later fool us into makingunderperfoming and high mainteance machines like Humphrey, Hank and Hattori)*
- The CNC frindly rack and pinion gemotry makes for faster production of DIY drive systems than involute gears, has good performance and makes it easy to intergrate rack geomery in other machiens parts

# 2015

**Highlights**:
- The Fabricatble Machines project was launched by Jens Dyvik and Jon Nordby
- First self made linear actuators

**Lessons learned**
- Keep part the count low. *(Better to put complexity in shapes. Let the machines make complex machines parts, and the humens do less assembling)*

**Fun facts:**
- Jens originaly named the project "Tractor systems", because his goal was to make DIY robust enough that would not break down when used by amateurs in shared workshops. Jon and Jens came up with Fabricatble Machines and renamed the project and repository.
